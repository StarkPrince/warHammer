aasignment-> schematic about roll crusher



screening/sieving (moisture is not desired)
what is it:
    separating the mixture into two or more fractions which are more  uniform in particle size than
    the orignal mixture
how is this done
    (chalni)  a cylindrical vessel with equal size hole at the base
why?
    to remove coarse particle for further size reduction
    to remove fine particle from crusher feed to save power by preventing them from overgrinding
    to grade the coarse particles into their commercial size
    to perform a step in the concentration of the product
1.stratification (inclined planes, rotating and surface movement are needed)
2.separation probability (difference between the size of the particle and the siever)
sieve shaker -> horizontal movement

material balance
effectiveness is the product of recovery and rejection.
    recovery is the amount of desired material over all the material passed down.


xd,xf,xb =  mass fractions of desired material in the product, feed and reject
1-xd,1-xf,1-xb = mass fractions of undesired material in the product, feed and reject


recovery = amount of desired material in product/ amount of desired material in the feed
           xd/xf
rejection = amount of undesired material in the reject/ amount of undesired material in the feed
           1-xd/1-xf


Screen effectiveness
how close is it seaparating the particles   


grizzlies:
    the effieciency is inversely proportional to capacity of the grizzlies
    usually used to separate particle of size 20-300mm and more
    less cost
    simple design
    no power requirement
    not that effective

application-
    in separation of undersize from the feed to primary crusher

a.gyration in horizontal plane
b.gyration in vertical plane
c.gyration at one end, shaking at other
d.shaking
e.mechanically vibrated
f.electronically vibrated

accicular->needle shaped one
flakey-> flat, just 2d

plastic forming
    jollying
    jiggering
    extrusion

m* = mass flow rate

ritinger's law
    the work done is proportional to the new surface area created
    P/m* = kR(1/Dsb-1/Dsa)
    P = pressure
    m* = mass flow rate
kick's law
    the work done is for a mass is constant for same reduction ratio
    p/m* = kKln(Dsa/Dsb)
bond crushing law
    the work done to perpare particles of size Dp from a very large size is
    proportional to surface to volume ratio
    p/m* = Kb/(Dp)**0.5

Jaw crushers:
    dodge -> upper part movable
    blake -> lower part movable
    denver -> both parts movable
the total theoritical capacity of double roll crusher is
    60*pie*D1*D3*Np*b
    b = breadth of roll face
cos(An/2) = (D1+D3)/(D1+D2)

the theoritical capacity of jaw crusher is:
    60*row(p)*A*Wj*Nj*(1-e) kg/hole
    row(p) = density of the material
    A = area of the swing
    Wj = width of the jaw
    Nj = number of swings per minute
    e = porosity of the material
